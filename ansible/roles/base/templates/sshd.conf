#LogLevel DEBUG

# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.
# See sshd_config(5) for more information on any settings used. Comments will be added only to clarify why a configuration was chosen.

# Basic configuration
# ===================

# Either disable or only allowssh root login via certificates.
PermitRootLogin no

# Define which port sshd should listen to. Default to `22`.
Port 22

# Address family should always be limited to the active network configuration.
AddressFamily inet

# Define which addresses sshd should listen to. Default to `0.0.0.0`, ie make sure you put your desired address in here, since otherwise sshd will listen to everyone.
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0

# List HostKeys here.
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key          # Req 20
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key          # Req 20
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key          # Req 20

# Security configuration
# ======================

# Set the protocol version to 2 for security reasons. Disables legacy support.
Protocol 2

# Make sure sshd checks file modes and ownership before accepting logins. This prevents accidental misconfiguration.
StrictModes yes

# Logging, obsoletes QuietMode and FascistLogging
SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel INFO

# Cryptography
# ------------

# **Ciphers** -- If your clients don't support CTR (eg older versions), cbc will be added
# CBC: is true if you want to connect with OpenSSL-base libraries
# eg ruby Net::SSH::Transport::CipherFactory requires cbc-versions of the given openssh ciphers to work
# -- see: (http://net-ssh.github.com/net-ssh/classes/Net/SSH/Transport/CipherFactory.html)
#
Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

# **Hash algorithms** -- Make sure not to use SHA1 for hashing, unless it is really necessary.
# Weak HMAC is sometimes required if older package versions are used
# eg Ruby's Net::SSH at around 2.2.* doesn't support sha2 for hmac, so this will have to be set true in this case.
#

MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-ripemd160

# Alternative setting, if OpenSSH version is below v5.9
#MACs hmac-ripemd160

# **Key Exchange Algorithms** -- Make sure not to use SHA1 for kex, unless it is really necessary
# Weak kex is sometimes required if older package versions are used
# eg ruby's Net::SSH at around 2.2.* doesn't support sha2 for kex, so this will have to be set true in this case.

# Authentication
# --------------

# Secure Login directives.
UseLogin no
UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox
LoginGraceTime 30s
MaxAuthTries 2
MaxSessions 10
MaxStartups 10:30:100

# Enable public key authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Never use host-based authentication. It can be exploited.
IgnoreRhosts yes
IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
HostbasedAuthentication no

# Enable PAM to enforce system wide rules
UsePAM yes

{% if ssh_key_and_password %}
AuthenticationMethods publickey,password
PasswordAuthentication yes
{% else %}
AuthenticationMethods publickey
PasswordAuthentication no
{% endif %}

PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Only enable Kerberos authentication if it is configured.
KerberosAuthentication no
KerberosOrLocalPasswd no
KerberosTicketCleanup yes
#KerberosGetAFSToken no

# Only enable GSSAPI authentication if it is configured.
GSSAPIAuthentication no
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# In case you don't use PAM (`UsePAM no`), you can alternatively restrict users and groups here. For key-based authentication this is not necessary, since all keys must be explicitely enabled.




# Network
# -------

# Disable TCP keep alive since it is spoofable. Use ClientAlive messages instead, they use the encrypted channel
TCPKeepAlive no

# Manage `ClientAlive..` signals via interval and maximum count. This will periodically check up to a `..CountMax` number of times within `..Interval` timeframe, and abort the connection once these fail.
ClientAliveInterval 600
ClientAliveCountMax 3

# Disable tunneling
PermitTunnel no

# Disable forwarding tcp connections.
# no real advantage without denied shell access
AllowTcpForwarding yes

# Disable agent formwarding, since local agent could be accessed through forwarded connection.
# no real advantage without denied shell access
AllowAgentForwarding yes

# Do not allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses.
GatewayPorts no

# Disable X11 forwarding, since local X11 display could be accessed through forwarded connection.
X11Forwarding no
X11UseLocalhost yes

# User environment configuration
# ==============================

PermitUserEnvironment no

# Misc. configuration
# ===================

Compression no

UseDNS no
